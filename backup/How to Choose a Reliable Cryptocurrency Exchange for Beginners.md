## Key Criteria for Selecting an Exchange  

### **1. Security: Prioritizing Asset Protection**  
Security should be your top priority. Top-tier exchanges like Binance and OKX implement advanced measures such as:  
- Cold storage for 90%+ of user funds  
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Regular security audits  

**Action Tip:** Start with first-tier platforms to minimize risks. Use second-tier exchanges only for small investments or unique trading opportunities.  

### **2. Supported Cryptocurrencies**  
The number of listed assets varies between platforms:  
- **Top-tier exchanges:** Focus on major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, etc.) and select altcoins.  
- **Second-tier exchanges:** Often list emerging tokens but with lower liquidity.  

**FAQ:** *Why donâ€™t top exchanges list all cryptocurrencies?*  
Top exchanges prioritize security and due diligence. They avoid projects with weak fundamentals or regulatory risks.
