# What is Scalping Trading Strategy?

## Key Takeaways
- Scalping trading focuses on capturing tiny price movements through high-frequency trades
- Requires strict risk management and discipline
- Combines technical analysis tools like moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and momentum indicators
- Offers frequent opportunities but demands specialized skills
- Not suitable for all investors due to its intensive nature

## Understanding Scalping Trading

Scalping trading represents one of the most intensive forms of short-term trading strategies. This approach involves executing dozens or even hundreds of trades within a single day, aiming to capture minimal price differentials through rapid position entries and exits. Professional scalpers typically hold positions for mere seconds to minutes, never carrying positions overnight.

The core principle lies in accumulating small profits that compound over time. A typical scalping operation might target 0.5-1% per trade while maintaining strict stop-loss parameters. This strategy thrives in highly liquid markets where bid-ask spreads remain narrow, enabling efficient execution.

## Strategies and Techniques

### Technical Analysis Framework
Professional scalpers employ sophisticated technical analysis frameworks to identify micro-trends:

| Indicator       | Application in Scalping                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Moving Averages | Detect short-term trend direction         |
| Bollinger Bands | Identify volatility squeezes and breakouts|
| MACD            | Confirm momentum shifts                   |
| RSI             | Spot overbought/oversold conditions       |

These tools work synergistically to create high-probability trade setups. For instance, a scalper might combine a 5-period moving average crossover with Bollinger Band expansion to confirm breakout opportunities.

### Execution Mechanics
Successful scalping requires:
1. Level 2 market data access for order flow analysis
2. Direct market access (DMA) for instant execution
3. Customized trading platforms with hotkey functionality
4. Predefined profit targets and stop-loss levels
