## What Is an NFT?  

NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, representing ownership of specific items like art, music, or virtual collectibles. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are **non-fungible**, meaning each token has distinct properties that prevent direct exchange for another.  

### Key Characteristics of NFTs:  
- **Scarcity**: Limited editions or one-of-a-kind creations.  
- **Ownership Verification**: Blockchain ensures transparent and immutable records.  
- **Monetization**: Creators set prices and earn royalties on secondary sales.

## How Do NFTs Work?  

NFTs rely on **smart contracts**â€”self-executing agreements encoded on blockchains like Ethereum. These contracts govern ownership, transferability, and royalty distribution. When you mint an NFT, youâ€™re essentially creating a digital certificate of authenticity stored permanently on the blockchain.

## Who Can Create an NFT?  

Anyone with a digital asset and basic tools can enter the NFT space. Whether youâ€™re an artist, musician, or entrepreneur, platforms like OpenSea and Rarible provide user-friendly interfaces for **minting NFTs**.
