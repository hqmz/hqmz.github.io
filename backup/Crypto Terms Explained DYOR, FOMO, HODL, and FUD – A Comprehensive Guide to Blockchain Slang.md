## Understanding Crypto Community Slang  

### What Does "GM" and "GN" Mean in Crypto?  
**GM (Good Morning)** and **GN (Good Night)** are widely used greetings in crypto communities. These phrases reflect the culture of camaraderie among blockchain enthusiasts, often appearing in Discord servers, Twitter threads, and Telegram groups.  

### FOMO: Fear of Missing Out in Crypto  
**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)** drives rapid market movements. When a tokenâ€™s price surges unexpectedly, investors may panic-buy to avoid losing potential gains. For example, during the 2021 Dogecoin rally, retail traders rushed to buy DOGE, fueled by FOMO.  

### Why DYOR Matters in Crypto Investments  
**DYOR (Do Your Own Research)** emphasizes the importance of due diligence. Relying on influencers or unverified sources can lead to poor decisions. Always analyze whitepapers, team backgrounds, and use cases before investing.
