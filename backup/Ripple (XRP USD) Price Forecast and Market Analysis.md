## Technical Indicators and Key Levels  

### 55-Period Moving Average: Bullish Confirmation  
The 55-period moving average acts as a dynamic support level, currently at **$0.1720**. Sustained price action above this level reinforces the bullish case for Ripple.

However, a breakout above this resistance could accelerate gains toward **$0.2190**, the next major resistance target. Conversely, a rejection at this band might signal bearish momentum, with immediate support at **$0.1900**.
