## Step-by-Step Deposit Process  

### 1. Access the Deposit Page  
You can navigate to the deposit section in two ways:  
- **Direct Access**: Open the OKX app and tap **Deposit** on the home screen.  
- **Via Assets Menu**: Go to **Assets > Deposit** for a streamlined path.  

Both methods lead to the same deposit interface, ensuring flexibility based on user preference.  

### 2. Select Cryptocurrency and Network  
Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP). **Critical**: Always confirm the correct network associated with your chosen crypto. For example:  
- **BTC**: Use the Bitcoin blockchain.  
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Select the Ethereum network.  
Mismatching networks risks permanent fund loss.  

### 3. Generate Deposit Information  
After selecting your crypto and network, OKX auto-generates:  
- A unique deposit address  
- A QR code for quick scanning  

### 4. Specify Deposit Destination  
Ensure the "Deposit to" field shows your OKX account. This confirms funds will credit correctly.  

### 5. Complete the Transaction  
You have two options:  
- **Copy Address**: Paste the deposit address into your external wallet or exchange withdrawal interface.  
- **Scan QR Code**: Use your camera or wallet app to scan the QR code directly from the OKX app.  

### 6. Share Deposit Details (Optional)  
Tap **Share Deposit Information** to send your deposit address to others via email or messaging apps.

## Important Security Notes  

### Network Compatibility  
Always verify the deposit network matches between OKX and the sending platform. Using an incorrect network (e.g., sending BEP-20 tokens to a TRC-20 address) will result in irreversible fund loss.  

### Minimum Deposit Requirements  
Check the **Deposit Page** for:  
- **Minimum Amount**: Deposits below this threshold won't be credited.  
- **Confirmations Needed**: Most blockchains require 12â€“30 confirmations for security.  
- **Contract Address**: Required for certain tokens like USDT ERC-20.  

### Memo/Tag Requirements  
For cryptocurrencies like **XRP** or **EOS**, you must include a **memo/tag** (usually a numeric code) when initiating the transfer. Failure to include this will result in lost funds.

## Best Practices for Secure Deposits  

1. **Start with Small Amounts**: Test with a small transaction before large deposits.  
2. **Verify Addresses**: Cross-check deposit addresses using copy-paste instead of manual entry.
