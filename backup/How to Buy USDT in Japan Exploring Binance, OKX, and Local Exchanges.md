## Can You Use Binance or OKX in Japan?  

### Binance in Japan: Regulatory Restrictions  
Binance, once a global leader in crypto trading, faced regulatory challenges in Japan. Since 2021, the **Financial Services Agency (FSA)** has restricted Binance's operations, prohibiting direct fiat-to-crypto transactions for Japanese users. However, workarounds exist:  
- **P2P Trading**: Users can trade USDT directly with peers using Japanese yen (JPY) via Binance's peer-to-peer marketplace.  
- **Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps**: Purchase Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) with yen through local exchanges, then transfer these assets to Binance for USDT conversion.
