## What Is Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic (ETC) represents the original Ethereum blockchain, preserved through a hard fork in 2016 following the infamous **$50 million DAO hack**. While Ethereum (ETH) reversed the hack via a hard fork, ETC developers prioritized blockchain immutability, maintaining the original transaction history.

### Core Characteristics
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making
- **Smart Contract Platform**: Supports dApp development

> "ETC's commitment to unalterable blockchain principles distinguishes it from Ethereum's evolving framework."

## How Ethereum Classic Operates

### Technical Foundation
As a pre-fork Ethereum version, ETC retains the original codebase while implementing unique upgrades. Key operational aspects include:
1. **Mining Process**: Miners validate transactions using computational power
2. **Security Enhancements**: Post-2020 51% attack mitigation strategies
3. **dApp Ecosystem**: Over 2,000 decentralized applications built on EVM-compatible infrastructure

### Network Advantages
- **Full Blockchain Replication**: All nodes maintain complete transaction records
- **Anti-Censorship Architecture**: No centralized control points
