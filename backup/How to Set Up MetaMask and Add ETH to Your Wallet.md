# How to Set Up MetaMask and Add ETH to Your Wallet  

## Introduction to MetaMask and Decentralized Finance  

MetaMask is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain applications (dApps), enabling users to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, and Web3 ecosystems. Unlike traditional banking systems, DeFi platforms built on blockchain networks like Ethereum allow users to lend, borrow, trade, and farm assets without intermediaries. This autonomy often results in higher returns, with some dApps offering annual percentage yields (APYs) exceeding 10%â€”a stark contrast to conventional savings accounts.  

To participate in this decentralized economy, users require a secure wallet like MetaMask. This guide will walk you through setting up your MetaMask wallet, adding ETH, and connecting to dApps.
